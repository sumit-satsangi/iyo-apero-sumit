## Why the book now?

In my humble opinion, it is a good practice to go through the basics once a while and what can be better than Statistics. Started reading the book <b>Introductory Business Statistics</b> and it's quite refreshing to go through the topics again which make the very foundation of Data Analytics.

## Plan

The idea is to share my notes on a weekly basis. The content will be in the order of the book. Will try to add the page or topic reference according to the location of the book. Weekdays are for reading the content and weekend is to compile it in markdown and share it.
